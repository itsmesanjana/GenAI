📘 Overview

Welcome to GenAI — a collection of my hands-on experiments in Generative AI.
This repo captures my learning journey across multiple sessions — from simple prompt-to-response generation to advanced document understanding using RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation).

⚡ Sessions Summary
🧠 Session 1 — Prompt → Response Generation

Implemented text generation using Gemini Flash API.

Explored how LLMs handle direct prompts and structured outputs.

⚙️ Session 2 — LangChain & Workflow Automation

Integrated LangChain for pipeline-based LLM operations.

Experimented with chaining prompts and managing context.

📄 Session 3 — RAG Paper Reader Application

Created a prototype RAG Reader capable of parsing unstructured documents (like IEEE research papers).

Handled layouts with multi-columns, tables, and figures.

Designed logic to maintain contextual flow for LLM input.

🧩 Tech Stack

Python, Jupyter Notebooks

Gemini Flash API, LangChain, PyPDF for doc reading

GitHub for version control & progress tracking

🚀 Goal

To build a progressive repository that explores and demonstrates Generative AI applications — starting from prompt engineering to full-fledged AI-driven automation systems.

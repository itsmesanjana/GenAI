📘 Overview

Welcome to GenAI — a collection of my hands-on experiments in Generative AI.
This repository captures my learning journey across multiple sessions — from simple prompt-to-response generation to advanced document understanding and image intelligence using multimodal models.

⚡ Sessions Summary
🧠 Session 1 — Prompt → Response Generation

Implemented text generation using Gemini Flash API.

Explored how LLMs handle direct prompts and structured outputs.

⚙️ Session 2 — LangChain & Workflow Automation

Integrated LangChain for pipeline-based LLM operations.

Experimented with prompt chaining, context management, and workflow automation.

📄 Session 3 — RAG Paper Reader Application

Built a RAG-based Reader to extract insights from unstructured documents like IEEE research papers.

Handled multi-column layouts, tables, and figures.

Developed logic to preserve document context for accurate LLM comprehension.

🖼️ Session 4 — AI Image Analyzer (Multimodal App)

Designed a Streamlit-based interactive web app using Gemini 2.0 Flash.

Allows users to upload any image and perform tasks like:

🚀 Analyze Image: Ask custom questions about visual content.

🖼️ Generate Caption: Create meaningful, detailed captions.

😃 Emotion Detection: Identify the emotion or mood conveyed by the image.

Features include:

Sidebar settings for model selection & creativity control.

Downloadable responses and session-based chat history.

Polished UI with modern dark theme and animations.

🧩 Tech Stack

Python, Streamlit, Jupyter Notebooks

Gemini Flash API, LangChain, PyPDF, PIL

GitHub for version control & continuous progress tracking

🚀 Goal

To create a progressive repository that explores and showcases Generative AI capabilities — from prompt engineering to RAG systems and multimodal AI applications.

🌟 What’s Next

More GenAI experiments coming soon — pushing boundaries with agents, voice AI, and advanced multimodal LLM workflows. Stay tuned 👀

Therefore, a higher concentration, for example, of bivalent metal cations in the samples of Horizons O and A of the soil is expected, considering the effect of the presence of silicate compounds in the metal retention, where a greater cation-exchange capacity (CEC) of the soil denotes a higher availability of binding sites for the metal after the exit of cations or protons associated with these silicates, due to the negative surface charge of the latter.
